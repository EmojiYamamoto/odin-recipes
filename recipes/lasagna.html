<p>Comfort food doesn't get much more classic than this Italian favourite, featuring layers of rich beef mince and a creamy sauce.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>250g beef mince</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
    <li>400g tin chopped tomato</li>
    <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</li>
    <il>150g pack mozzarella, shredded </li>
</ul>
<h2>For the white sauce</h2>
<ul>
    <li>50g butter</li>
    <li>50g plain flour </li>
    <li>550ml semi-skimmed milk </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat.</li>
    <li>Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato purée and chopped tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
