<p>Comfort food doesn't get much more classic than this Italian favourite, featuring layers of rich beef mince and a creamy sauce.</p>
<ul>1 tbsp olive oil</ul>
<ul>250g beef mince</ul>
<ul>1 tbsp tomato purée</ul>
<ul>400g tin chopped tomato</ul>
<ul>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</ul>
<ul>9-12 lasagne sheets (depending on the size of your baking dish)</ul>
<ul>150g pack mozzarella, shredded </ul>
<h1>For the white sauce</h1>
<ul>50g butter</ul>
<ul>50g plain flour </ul>
<ul>550ml semi-skimmed milk </ul>
<ol>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat.</ol>
<ol>Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden.</ol>
<ol>tir in the tomato purée and chopped tomatoes.</ol>
<ol>Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</ol>
<ol>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</ol>
<ol>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</ol>
