<p>These easy beef burritos come together in no time and are loaded with spices, vegetables and flavor! A simple, healthier and easy dinner idea that you need in your life!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ground beef</li>
    <li>Spices (cumin, black pepper, chili flakes and oregano)</li>
    <li>Vegetables (cauliflower, bell peppers and zucchini)</li>
    <li>Sauce (any of preference)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to make</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by making the filling. Cook your beef with olive oil and spices you enjoy. As I mentioned I used cumin, chili flakes, black pepper and oregano. In 4-5 minutes add in the bell pepper, some garlic, some scallions, zucchini and thinly chopped cauliflower. Reduce the heat and cover with a lid to allow the ingredients to cook through for a few minutes. Stir in the spinach, add some tomato paste and a squeeze of lemon. Turn the heat off.</li>
    <li>Assemble the burritos. Place the ground beef filling in the middle of a tortilla, then some cheese on top, yogurt garlic sauce (or another sauce of choice) and guacamole on top and fold the tortilla on each side like an envelope.</li>
    <li>Toast the burrito in a nonstick pan with some olive oil until golden brown. This will make it crispier and help seal the tortilla, so that the filling stays inside. Enjoy immediately.</li>
